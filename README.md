# Sentiment-analysis-with-AI-Thesis
This repository contains my codes and experiments associated with my master thesis. I will develop a sentiment analysis investment strategy using natural language processing, thanks to machine learning techniques.
On the other side, I am using the https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews renamed as "Combined_News_DJIA.csv" as input of the DJIA_sentiment.py model.
