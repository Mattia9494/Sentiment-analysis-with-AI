# Sentiment-analysis-with-AI-Thesis
This repository contains my codes and experiments associated with my master thesis. I will develop a sentiment analysis investment strategy using natural language processing, thanks to machine learning techniques.

The "Combined_News_DJIA.csv" comes from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews and works as input of the DJIA_sentiment.py machine learning model.

preprocessing.py contains all the formulas used to preprocess the current text.

All the other files are provisory at the moment since the work is still in prograss.
