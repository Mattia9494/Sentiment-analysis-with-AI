# Sentiment-analysis-with-AI-Thesis
This repository contains my codes and experiments associated with my master thesis. I will develop a sentiment analysis investment strategy using natural language processing, thanks to machine learning techniques.

The "Combined_News_DJIA.csv" comes from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews and works as input of the DJIA_sentiment.py machine learning model.

preprocessing.py contains all the formulas used to preprocess the current text.

Applied_model.py is used to test the validity of the model with some days characterized by the presence of breaking news in the world due to main historical or political events, such as the Trump election.

All the other files are provisory at the moment since the work is still in prograss.
